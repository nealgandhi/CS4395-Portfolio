# HLT Homework 2 Overview

In this assignment we were tasked with understanding what it means to preprocess text and creating a word guessing game based on the mutation we do to the data. We had to take in a text file, anat19, which is an excerpt of an anatomy textbook from 2019, and extract the 50 most common nouns from it by using NLTK. After we extracted the nouns, we had to randomly select one from the top 50 and play a word guessing game with in, where we have to guess the letters in a hangman style play to figure the word out.
