### Homework 1

This was a homework to help us understand the basics of python text processing in preparation for the upcoming assignments. We were to take in employee information formatted in different ways and mutate the data into the same format by using regex to compare strings to ensure that each item was formatted in the right way.

### Homework 2

This was an assingment to help us understand the basic functionality of the NLTK library and preprocessing text, to help better understand how to change data based on requirements. We were to take in a textbook file and return the top 50 most common nouns, and then play a hangman style guessing game by randomly selecting one of the nouns.
