# Homework 4

## Neal Gandhi & Nina Rao

In this assignment, we were tasked to set up and learn how the n-gram modeling technqiue functions and how it can be applied to understand data. The main usage of N-gram modeling is to predict the next word in a given phrase or sentence. This is done by calculating probabilities and determining the word with the highest probable chance of being the next. We were tasked to take in 3 different sets of data, all in a different langauge, convert them into unigram and bigram dictionaries, pickle the dictionaries, and then compute the probability for each language using Laplace smoothing.
