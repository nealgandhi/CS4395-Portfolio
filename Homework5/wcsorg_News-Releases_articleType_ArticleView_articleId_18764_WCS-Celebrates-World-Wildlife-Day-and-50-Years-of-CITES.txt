The Wildlife Conservation Society is recognizing World Wildlife Day, March 3, 2023, with a video featuring a message from WCS’s Interim President and CEO Robb Menzi.Recognition of World Wildlife Day each year was proclaimed by the United Nations General Assembly in 2013 as a way to raise awareness of the world’s wild flora and fauna.The date of March 3 was chosen as it is the anniversary of the establishment of CITES, the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora, signed in 1973.World Wildlife Day this year celebrates 50 years of CITES with the theme: Partnerships for Wildlife Conservation.In the video, Menzi says: “We can never underestimate the power of CITES over the past five decades.There have been many successes, from elephants and tigers, to parrots and sharks, with many species still in the wild and some even recovering, due to the foresight of those who drafted and agreed to this landmark treaty.“Effective conservation is always powered by partnerships.And The Wildlife Conservation Society is proud to have been a partner from the treaty’s inception - and to have had WCS teams at all CITES meetings since the beginning.”
